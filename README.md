# Predicting Influencers in Social Network

The project is divided into three major parts:<br/>

**1. Data exploration and feature selection** - To get an idea of the distribution of the data, skewness of the classes and features, and correlation between features.<br/>
**2. Exploring various Machine Learning models** - To get an insight of which model works best for the prediction, depending on the type of input data.<br/>
**3. Analysis of performance of Machine Learning models** - To answer the questions about the kind of performance of the model by doing research about its mathematical logic (for example, why one model worked best and the other performed badly)
